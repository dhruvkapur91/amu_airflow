If you are setting this first time, registering to aws might need some time and your credit card. The charge shouldn't be much though (less than 2$?)

NOTE: This instance has fairly low security and use it only for demo. Shut the instance down after demo.

0. login to aws
1. if region is not Ohio, change it to Ohio
2. click launch vm 
3. Select the ami with given id
4. choose a t2 medium instance (while t2 micro is free, but it might not work as we are running quite a few heavy images)
5. create a security group - allow all at 22 and 8080
6. create a security key
7. go to instance screen and connect it using ssh or internet
